## [Project 1: Investment Dashboard (Python, Dash, AWS, PostgreSQL)](https://github.com/SylviaCooperhouse/investment)

A Python-based platform hosted on AWS, designed to monitor and analyze portfolio performance and risk exposure. It integrates stock and cryptocurrency data, calculates Value at Risk (VaR) using multiple methodologies (Historical, Parametric, Monte Carlo), and visualizes insights through an interactive Dash dashboard. Key features include:

- Automated data fetching and daily updates.
- Portfolio breakdowns, risk metrics, and alerts for significant changes.
- Centralized data management leveraging AWS services and PostgreSQL.

This project provides data-driven investment decision support through advanced risk modeling and real-time analysis.

## [Project 2: Diamond Price Estimation Data Analysis (Python, Flask, Scikit-learn)](https://github.com/SylviaCooperhouse/dimond-price-analysis)

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of diamond pricing using a Kaggle dataset, aiming to build an accurate pricing model based on various attributes like carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and dimensions. Highlights include:

- **Tools and Techniques:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Flask API.
- Developed predictive models: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
- Achieved 98.14% price variance explanation with the Random Forest model.
- Created a Flask API for real-time price predictions based on user input.

This project serves as a valuable resource for consumers, jewelers, and industry professionals interested in diamond pricing dynamics and predictive modeling techniques.

## [Project 4: Sample SQL Functions (PostgreSQL)](https://github.com/SylviaCooperhouse/My_Portfolio_Website/tree/main/SQL%20function%20Samples)

### Function 1: public.update_table_records()
- **Purpose:** Tracks changes in tables within a PostgreSQL schema by:
  - Inserting new tables into a tracking table.
  - Deleting records for tables that no longer exist.
- **Application:** Essential for database schema management and ensuring data integrity.

### Function 2: schema.track_daily_user_count
- **Purpose:** Tracks daily user counts and actions within a specified date range.
- **Application:** Useful for monitoring user engagement and activity trends.

These functions demonstrate advanced database management techniques and data monitoring.
