# [Project 1: Diamond Price Estimation Data Analysis](https://github.com/SylviaCooperhouse/dimond-price-analysis)

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of diamond pricing using a Kaggle dataset, aiming to build an accurate pricing model based on various attributes like carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and dimensions. Employing Python and libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, I performed exploratory data analysis, visualization, and developed predictive models including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest Regression. The Random Forest model achieved remarkable accuracy, explaining 98.14% of price variance. I also created a user-friendly Flask API enabling real-time price predictions based on user input. Explore key visualizations highlighting price distributions, correlations, and more below. This project serves as a valuable resource for consumers, jewelers, and industry professionals interested in diamond pricing dynamics and predictive modeling techniques.
