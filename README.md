## [Project 3: Diamond Price Estimation Data Analysis (Python, Flask, Scikit-learn)](https://github.com/SylviaCooperhouse/dimond-price-analysis)

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of diamond pricing using a Kaggle dataset, aiming to build an accurate pricing model based on various attributes like carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and dimensions. Highlights include:

- **Tools and Techniques:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Flask API.
- Developed predictive models: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
- Achieved 98.14% price variance explanation with the Random Forest model.
- Created a Flask API for real-time price predictions based on user input.

This project serves as a valuable resource for consumers, jewelers, and industry professionals interested in diamond pricing dynamics and predictive modeling techniques.
