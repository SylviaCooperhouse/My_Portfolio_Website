# Project 1: Diamond Prices Data Analysis
Developed a Diamond Price Estimation and Analysis project to gain insights into the factors influencing diamond prices and to build an accurate price prediction model. Achieved a high model accuracy of 98% using Random Forest Regression.

Key Project Components:

1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
   - Obtained a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle containing information on diamond attributes, including carat, cut quality, color, clarity, dimensions, and price.
   - Conducted data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features such as cut, color, and clarity for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Utilized data visualization techniques to explore the dataset, visualize price distributions, and analyze the relationships between attributes.
   - Identified correlations between various factors and diamond prices.
3. Regression Modeling:
   - Explored multiple regression techniques, including Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression, to estimate diamond prices based on carat weight.
   - Implemented a Random Forest Regression model, achieving a remarkable 98% accuracy, making it the preferred model for price estimation.
